# Challenge - Color Box Activity

In the terminal, make sure you're on the desktop and 
* use ```create-react-app``` plus your project name    
* cd into your project
* type ```atom .``` (or ```code .``` if you are using Visual Studio)
* take out any starter code you want to remove and proceed with the user stories below

### Color Box - User Stories
* As a user, I can see a white square on the screen.

* As a user, when I click on the square a word shows up (a color).  Each time I click it cycles through a list of these colors (one per click) - white, green, blue, yellow, red, purple, and orange.

### Stretch

* As a user, when the box is cycling through the words, the background is the same as the color word.

* As a user, I can see many color boxes on the page all acting independently of one another.

### Super Stretch

* As a user, when the box is cycling through the words, the background is the same as the color word.

* As a user, I can see many color boxes on the page all acting independently of one another.


# Getting Started

After you accept the assignment (or clone this repo), you'll want to install all the npm packages using Yarn:

```bash
$ cd ./color-box-activity
$ yarn install
```
If you get an error about Yarn not being found:

```bash
Command 'yarn' not found, but can be installed with:
sudo apt install cmdtest
```
You can install it with:

```bash
$ npm install -g yarn
```
Then run ```yarn install``` one more time and then you are ready to start a server to run the application:

```bash
$ yarn start
```
Now you're ready to code!
